This is a contact form built using the Codeigniter PHP framework.
Apart from the php logic which validates all the input information it also has the Google reCaptcha test which prevents spamming.
The reCaptcha test for this application requires both a sitekey and a secretkey in order to function properly.
The keys can be acquired from the google website.
After the form is submited successfully a contact email is sent and the input data in inserted in the database.
Folder 'config' has a file named 'email.php' which contains the headers for sending the email.
In the same folder the file named 'recaptcha.php' holds the  keys used for reCaptcha test.
